# EH-calibration
Franka emika panda3 with object detection camera realsense D345i
Here are the general steps you would need to follow:

Install the necessary software:
Install libfranka and franka_ros to control the Franka Emika Panda robot.
Install realsense-ros for interfacing with the Realsense camera.
Install MoveIt for motion planning.
Install OpenCV for image processing and marker detection.
Install aruco_ros if you are using ArUco markers for calibration.
Set up your ROS environment:
Create a catkin workspace and clone the necessary repositories into the src directory.
Build the workspace using catkin build and source the setup.bash file.
Print and prepare the calibration pattern:
Print the calibration chessboard or ArUco marker with accurate dimensions.
Place the pattern in the robot’s workspace where it can be easily seen by the camera.
Collect calibration data:
Move the robot to various positions where the calibration pattern is visible to the camera.
At each position, record the pose of the robot’s end-effector and the image from the camera.
Perform the calibration:
Use the recorded data to compute the transformation between the camera and the robot’s end-effector.
This can be done using the calibrateHandEye function in OpenCV or similar functions provided in the ROS packages.
Validate the calibration:
After computing the transformation, validate the results by testing the robot’s performance in tasks that rely on the camera’s input.
For detailed instructions, you should refer to the documentation provided in the repositories mentioned above. They contain step-by-step guides and often include scripts to automate parts of the process. It’s important to follow these instructions carefully to ensure a successful calibration.

Remember to replace placeholder values such as marker_size, camera_matrix, and dist_coeffs with the actual calibration parameters of your camera and marker. These parameters are crucial for the accuracy of the calibration and can be obtained through a camera calibration process using tools provided by the camera manufacturer or OpenCV.

Please note that while the code and steps provided are a good starting point, calibration is a complex process that may require troubleshooting and adjustments based on your specific setup and requirements. If you encounter any issues, the communities around these repositories can be a valuable resource for support.
