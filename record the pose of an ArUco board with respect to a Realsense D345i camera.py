In this code:

Replace fx, fy, cx, cy, k1, k2, p1, p2, and k3 with the actual camera matrix and distortion coefficients obtained from
your camera calibration.
Adjust markersX, markersY, markerLength, and markerSeparation to match the actual ArUco board you are using.
This script will display the video feed from the camera and draw the detected markers and axes on the board. 
It will also print out the rotation and translation vectors representing the pose of the board with respect to the 
camera.

Make sure you have the pyrealsense2 and opencv-contrib-python packages installed in your Python environment to
run this code. You can install them using pip:

pip install pyrealsense2
pip install opencv-contrib-python

Please note that accurate camera calibration is crucial for the pose estimation to be correct. 
The calibration process involves capturing images of a known pattern (like a checkerboard) from different angles 
and using them to compute the camera parameters. OpenCV provides functions such as cv2.calibrateCamera for this purpose. If you havenâ€™t done this yet, you should calibrate your camera before attempting to estimate the pose of the ArUco board.
